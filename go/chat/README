# Very simple long polling chat engine

Current status: proof of concept.

Target: (i) simple library to create web chats (serve side and JS SDK) and (ii) demo.

## Quick start

Run engine:

```
go run ./cmd/chat/...
```

Playing with `curl`:

```
curl -d 'Hi!' http://localhost:8080/chat/send
curl -d 'Hi there!' http://localhost:8080/chat/send
curl -d 'id=0' http://localhost:8080/chat/poll
{"messages":[{"text":"Hi there!"},{"text":"Hi!"}],"next":2}
curl -d 'id=2' http://localhost:8080/chat/poll
...long polling...
```

UI: Just open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser and chat.

## Low-level contract (draft)

### Send

Just text (has to be json in future):

### Poll

Request

- id of last message that we already have

Response

- list of message (most recent first)
- id of the most recent message

## TODO

- Isolate library part: Message (including validation) has to be put outside
- JS SDK (jQuery free)
- Nicknames, colors (after Message type isolation)
- Chat window: limit number of messages, scrolling, etc.
- Client- and server-side check: remove ctl chars, care about empty messages, etc
- Contract: let send returns registered-as id: string vector increasing id
- Multiply chat rooms
- Logging, error handling, health checking, statistics
- TODOs in code
- Setup CI
