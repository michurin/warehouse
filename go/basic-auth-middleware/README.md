HTTP basic authentication middleware. Very simple, but 100% tested, stable, time leaking proof.

## TODO

- ugly naming
- ~~introduce some sort of dedicated cred provider?~~ `[DONE]`
- ~~`realm` customization~~ `[DONE]`
- ~~`realm` validation~~ `[DONE]`
- demo `main.go`
- tests are `curl`-ish, does that really make them a bad?
- test coverage
- usage in `README`
- godoc
