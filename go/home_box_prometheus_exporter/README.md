# Prometheus exporter

This is a first take to write Prometheus exporter for my home box. This take works, but it obviously ugly and need to be rewritten.

It measures: temperatures of components and network utilization.

I'm going to play with it, find better way to organize metics and add at least monitoring of [block devices utilization](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/block/stat.txt). It will be great to show examples of usage and configuration.
