\CVSection{Experience}

%------------------------------------------------

\CVItem{Jan 2021 -- present, Avito, Cross-functional team}{
Mostly Golang, PostgreSQL, Redis.

It is my most product-focused position. I learned here how to make
extremely flexible software, how to fit approaches to tests, logging, monitoring
into unpredictable requirements changes. How to deal with
contracts to ship new features faster and keep backward
compatibility. How to share knowledge to move faster and work under the same roof with
front-end engineers, designers, product-managers.
}

\CVItem{May 2018 -- Dec 2020, Gett, Payments and Fraud prevention}{
Golang, Python, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, PrestoDB, Redis, AWS.

The primary responsibility of our team was to support and develop payments infrastructure.
It was made up of lots of internal and external integrations as well as parts of business logic.
I also supported existing fraud prevention system based on ML.
}

\CVItem{Jun 2016 -- May 2018, Yandex, Weather forecasting system}{
Python, MapReduce, MongoDB, distributed computing.

We developed distributed system, that fetched weather data from different sources
and produced weather forecast based on ML. I was engaged into process of
significant modifications of system. We got global and began to process
more data sources. I was responsible for applying ML models and collecting
logs for training process. I designed not only the system itself, but also
degradation strategy, monitoring and other useful things.
}

\CVItem{Nov 2014 -- Jun 2016, Yandex, Advertising system}{
Python, Perl, MySQL, MapReduce, distributed computing.

Our team was focused on auction and bidding. I took part in development and investigations.
I also actively participated in design and development of RTB system.
I was feature owner and key developer for new banner enrichment feature.
In addition I contributed a bit to MapReduce engine.}

\CVItem{Dec 2006 -- Nov 2014, Vimpelcom (Beeline), Billing and Inventory}{
Python, Perl, MySQL, widespread distributed systems.

We managed Beeline WiFi and broadband networks with tens of thousands of network hardware
spread out over ten time zones. I was focused on control and monitoring system in
conjunction with billing system. For example, it switches shapers to align traffic to tariff and billing status of customer.
