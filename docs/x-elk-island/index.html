        <b>About project</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Four yeas ago I crated tiny project <a href="http://1000mines.com/" target="_blank">1000mines.com</a>.
        It is the classical minesweeper but without any bounds. My goal was to create a game I can play forever.
        <br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, 1000mines gained many fans all over the wold.
        I started getting more and more e-mails with thanks, ideas, features requests, issues...
        Thank you to all these people who support me!
        <br>
        <br>
        The most common issue, that many people pointed to, was statelessness of the game.
        You lost all your progress as soon as you close tab or browser.
        <br>
        <br>
        This problem is not so simple. Modern browsers care about wellness of your computer and
        they disallow web pages limitless resources consumption. So, it is impossible to save
        infinite state permanently. You can save relatively small opened areas,
        however you cannot save considerable achievements.
        It looks like sad and painful fact.
        <br>
        <br>
        I did a lot of thinking, how to combine indefiniteness of game and limits of browser.
        And I'm glad to share my idea. It is combination of minesweeper and Tetris: infinite game on finite area.
        <br>
        <br>
        I will be happy to get your feedback and ideas :-)
