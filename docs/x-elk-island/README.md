## Core ideas

- Inefficient code — ok: readability first (it has to allow to be rewrote entirely)
- Animation and design — minimum
- Store/restore state in local storage

## Main priorities (before publish)

+ Hide closed
+ Hide mines
- Title
- Favicon.ico
+ Remove debugging
+ Flags
+ Field size
- Mines density
+ Colors
+ Layout (css/min/max; mobile friendly)
- Count of lines and opens
+ Save state (on render)
- Save score
+ Restore state (on load)
- Gameover state
- Force new game button
+ "locked" badge ("wait" cursor shape)

## Ask community after pulish

- is it ok neighbors recalculation?
- the area has to be wider?
- do any suggestions on click on opened places?

## Second priority (after first release and announcement)

- Refactoring: factory for cells
- Personal offline score table
- Online score table
- Levels? Different sizes? Density?
- Delayed clicks? (when clicks are locked)
- Multitab
- Event handling (onmousedown/up, check on firefox, no safari)
- Countdown of lives
