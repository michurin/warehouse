## Core ideas

- Inefficient code — ok: readability first (it has to allow to be rewrote entirely)
- Animation and design — minimum
- Store/restore state in local storage

## Main priorities (before publish)

- Hide closed
- Flags
- Field size
- Mines density
- Colors
- Layout (css/min/max; mobile friendly)
- Count of lives
- Count of lines
- Save state (on render)
- Restore state (on load)
- Event handling (onmousedown/up, check on firefox, no safari)
- Gameover state
- "locked" badge

## Second priority (after first release and announcement)

- Refactoring: factory for cells
- Personal offline score table
- Online score table
- Levels? Different sizes? Density?
- Delayed clicks? (when clicks are locked)
